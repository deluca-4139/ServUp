SERVER UPTIME MONITOR
-----------------------------------------------

This is a standalone server uptime monitor, designed and coded by Domenick De Luca (c/o '21).

It was created to allow for modular testing of server uptime with SSH and HTTP ports (22 and 80) 
to monitor server status.


SYNOPSIS:

The program works by looping through all desired servers - hostnames or IPs - and testing their
response to a netcat connection. If it responds with an affirmative, the date and time is logged
in a log file (in /logs) sorted by server. If the connection times out after 5 
seconds when attempting a netcat connection, it logs the server as down and sends an email to a
specified email address notifying that the server is down with the same date/time information.

FILES:

exec.sh: runs a for loop through each of the config files to run the correct testing script based
on their ports (i.e. SSH vs HTTP). If you want to test a different port, you can copy/paste the for
loop and just create a new config file with a new testing script.

servup-*.cfg: CFG files that contain the list of servers (as said before, hostnames or IPs) that are
being tested. Feel free to edit these and add or remove whatever servers you want to test.

test_*.sh: these are the scripts that are run by ./exec.sh that take in a server name as an 
argument and then test netcat connection. In them,
they spawn a netcat connection and use expect to respond to the output. From this output, the
scripts run another script to parse to a log file (and email if necessary). If you're creating a
new one of these files to test for a different port, just change the port number in the line with
spawn netcat (in the default files, these ports are either 22 for SSH or 80 for HTTP) as well as
the lines that run the succeed.sh and timed_out.sh scripts, as the port number is a required
argument for those scripts if you want the port number to be in the logs.

succeeded.sh: takes in an argument for the server that needs to be logged and port that was tested.
Outputs to a log file with parsed date and time (seen in the variable declarations at the top) that
the server and port passed in were succesfully connected to (i.e. server is up). 

timed_out.sh: takes in the same arguments as the previous script but outputs to a log that the 
connection to the server timed out (i.e. that the server is down). It also sends an email alerting
to this fact as specified in the synopsis. You can change the email address in the mail line to 
whatever email address you want this mail to go to.

USAGE:

If there is not already one running, start a cron job to run ./exec.sh every 10 minutes or so. 
I don't believe anything more often than 5 minutes is necessary. You can run the script manually if
you want a realtime update of the server status.

If you've just cloned this, create a folder called logs/ and edit all the files that have _EDITME
appended to them. It should be obvious what you'll need to change; read this file again if you 
can't figure out what any of the files are supposed to be doing.
